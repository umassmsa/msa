Welcome to MSA’s 2nd annual NFL GM Challenge! <br><br>
You will take on the coveted mantle of general manager of an NFL team and compete against your peers via drafting, trades, and signings as you look to manage the salary cap while building the next Super Bowl winner! <br>

## How it works

- Every NFL team will have their five best players taken off the roster and added to a common pool for all 32 teams to draft from (i.e. the Cincinnati Bengals would lose Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and three more of their best players to the draft pool)
- Each group will represent one NFL team, and re-construct their roster by drafting from the pool of players while staying under the salary cap - rookies included!
- Trading – picks and players – is highly encouraged!
- _Only basic knowledge of the NFL is needed_ – we provide rosters, salary cap sheets with built in calculations, and draft resources, and are happy to answer any questions!
- Suggested group size is 2-3, _individual signups are highly encouraged as well!_ You do not need to already have a group to sign up for the event
